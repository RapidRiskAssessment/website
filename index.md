# Rapid Risk Assessment (RRA)

The Rapid Risk Assessment framework is licensed under the [MPL](LICENSE) and was originally created to rapidly formalize risk-based decision making (less than an hour). While inheriting from various prior frameworks, it focuses on the social aspect of the risk dicussions in order to favorite good outcomes, rather than perfect outcomes.

This means the RRA is more likely to result into important risks being surfaced and mitigated, rather and obscured and forgotten despite "security telling you to fix all the things".

# Get started!

1. Even if you're a seasoned risk professional, our [Risk TL;DR](assessing_security_risk.md) may pick your interest. This is a quick introdution to risk assessments in general.
2. Check our the Podcasts, videos, etc. below !
3. Read the Reference Documentation (see top menus), especially [RRA for services](rapid_risk_assessment.md)
4. Play with integrations, such as the Google Docs templates.

Eventually, we might add a real training documentation or video to get you started and train your friends and colleagues.
