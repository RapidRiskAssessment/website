# Rapid Risk Assessment (RRA)

The Rapid Risk Assessment framework is licensed under the [MPL](LICENSE) and was originally created to rapidly formalize risk-based decision making (less than an hour ‚è∞).

{% include feature_row %}

The RRA is based on previous frameworks, but focuses on the social aspect of the risk discussions in order to favor good outcomes, rather than perfect outcomes.

It surfaces and mitigates important risks that matter to the team, rather than checking lists of controls.

# Get started!

1. Even if you're a seasoned risk professional, our [Risk TL;DR](docs/assessing_security_risk) may pique your interest.
2. Check out the [Podcasts, videos, etc.](docs/podcasts) to get a feel for it!
3. Read the [Reference Documentation](docs/index), especially [RRA for services](docs/rapid_risk_assessment).
4. Play with [integrations](docs/integrations).

# Origins

The RRA concept was originally created at Mozilla under the [MPL](LICENSE-MPL) by [gdestuynder@](https://github.com/gdestuynder) and [jvehent@](https://github.com/jvehent) (after a walk on the beach) and improved with contributions from Mozilla's Information Security team.

Mozilla's Information security website can be found at [https://infosec.mozilla.org](https://infosec.mozilla.org).
