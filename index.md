# Rapid Risk Assessment (RRA)

The Rapid Risk Assessment framework is licensed under the [MPL](LICENSE) and was originally created to rapidly formalize risk-based decision making (less than an hour). While inheriting from various prior frameworks, it focuses on the social aspect of the risk dicussions in order to favorite good outcomes, rather than perfect outcomes.

This means the RRA is more likely to result into important risks being surfaced and mitigated, rather and obscured and forgotten despite "security telling you to fix all the things".

# Origins

The RRA concept was originally created at Mozilla under the [MPL](LICENSE) by gdestuynder@ and jvehent@ (after a walk on the beach). Mozilla's Information security website can be found at https://infosec.mozilla.org.
