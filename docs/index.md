See the sidebar to find documentation on the Rapid Risk Risk Assessment.

If you're already using the RRA, you may be looking for:

- The [Standard Levels](standard_levels) reference.
- The [Data Classification](data_classification) reference.

# First time?

1. Even if you're a seasoned risk professional, our [Risk TL;DR](assessing_security_risk) may pick your interest. If not, it's great starting point!
2. Check out the [Podcasts, videos, etc.](podcasts) to get a feel for how the RRA works.
3. Read the [RRA for services](rapid_risk_assessment) in order to assess services
4. Play with [integrations](integrations), templates, etc. for your own organization
5. Read about the fundamentals ([Why does it work?](primer)) that make the RRA work well. This is useful to implement your own assessments using the RRA building blocks, the RRA for services isn't the right fit.

# Just curious?

If you already do risk analysis on a day to day basis, and wonder what makes the RRA difference, have a look at the [Why does it work?](primer) document.
